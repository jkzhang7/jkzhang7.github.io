## An Assistive System for Upper Limb Motion Combining Functional Electrical Stimulation and Robotic Exoskeleton

- Designed a embedded system for robotics glove's control

- Programmed to control the movement of human's wrist joint, elbow joint and shoulder joint by Fuctional Electrical Stimulation and robotics exoskeleton

- Combined to an assistive system for upper limb motion and tested the system by conducting the experiments of grabbing subjects
