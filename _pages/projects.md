<!-- ## An Assistive System for Upper Limb Motion Combining Functional Electrical Stimulation and Robotic Exoskeleton

- Designed an embedded system for robotics glove’s control based on STM32 32-bit Arm Cortex MCU

- Programmed to control movement for human’s wrist joint, elbow joint and shoulder joint by Fuctional Electrical
Stimulation and robotics exoskeleton

- Integrated an assistive system for upper limb motion with 7 degrees of freedom and tested the system by conducting
grabbing experiments

## Control on a Novel Pick-and-place Robot

- Literature review about the schönies motion generator (SMG) and pick-and-place robot

- Improved the control scheme by applying Linear–quadratic regulator controller (LQR) and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)
to reduce trajectory-planning errors

- Conducted the simulation and the practical experiments to verify the control scheme

## An Energy Harvesting Device

- Designed and manufactured a system of energy harvesting that can transfer mechanical energy to electric energy in human
locomotion, which has a much higher energy conversion rate

- Built the actual experimental setup including LabView programming and measured the conversion rate

- Improved the design by changing the structure of locomotive part
