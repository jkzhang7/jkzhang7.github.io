## An Assistive System for Upper Limb Motion Combining Functional Electrical Stimulation and Robotic Exoskeleton

- Designed a embedded system for robotics glove's control

- Programmed to control the movement of human's wrist joint, elbow joint and shoulder joint by Fuctional Electrical Stimulation and robotics exoskeleton

- Combined to an assistive system for upper limb motion and tested the system by conducting the experiments of grabbing subjects

## Control on a Novel Pick-and-place Robot

- Literature review about the schönies motion generator (SMG) and pick-and-place robot

- Improve the control scheme by applying Linear–quadratic regulator controller and Extended Kalman Filter to reudce trajectory-planning error

- Conducted the simulation and the practical experiments to test the control scheme

## An Energy Harvesting Device

- Designed and manufactured a system of energy harvester that can transfer mechanical energy to electric energy in human locomotion, which has a much higher energy conversion rate

- Built the actual experimental setup including LabView programming and measured the conversion rate

- Improved the design by changing the structure of locomotive part
