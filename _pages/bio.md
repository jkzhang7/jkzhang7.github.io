## About me

Hey there! I am Jingkun Zhang, currently a visiting student at [Centre for Intelligent Machines](http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/) (CIM), supervised by [Prof. Jorge Angeles](http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~angeles/).

Before it, I just obtained my B.Sc degree in Mechanical Engineering from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://202.120.53.238/English/) (SJTU) in June 2018.Â I was fortunately advised by [Prof. Dingguo Zhang](http://bbl.sjtu.edu.cn/dgzhang) and [Prof. Tom Krupenkin](https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/me/Faculty/Krupenkin_Tom/) during my undergradute.

My research interests include Robotics Design and Control, Exoskeleton, Medical Devices and Rehabilitation.

I am applying for graduate school starting from Fall 2019 in North America now!
