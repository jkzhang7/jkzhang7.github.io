## Soccer

I am a huge soccer fan, have played soccer for almost 10 years, at high school team and college team. My favorite postion is right back and winger.

The photo of my last soccer game at SJTU is shown below.

## Traveling

I am also really into traveling, always willing to experience different cultures, foods and things.

Here is the photo I took in Ottawa, Canada in July 2018, which is Parliament Hill
